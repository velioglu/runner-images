# We placed the script in the "/usr/local/share/" directory while generating
# the golden image. However, it needs to be moved to the home directory because
# the runner creates some configuration files at the script location. Since the
# github runner vm is created with the runneradmin user, directory is first moved
# to runneradmin user's home directory. At the end of this script, it will be moved
# to runner user's home folder. We are checking first whether actions-runner exists
# under "usr/local/share to make sure that the script can be run multiple times idempotently.
